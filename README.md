# sensor-lib

`sensor-lib` is a small C library that exposes a generic instrument API for radio and positioning actions. The current implementation focuses on:

- Bluetooth adapter discovery and nearby device scanning
- Wi-Fi adapter discovery and nearby network/device scanning
- GPS polling through `gpsd`

The library is intentionally lightweight. It uses caller-provided output buffers, avoids unnecessary heap allocation in hot paths, and keeps the public interface in plain C.

## Status

This repository currently provides:

- A C implementation of [`interfaces/c/instrument_api.h`](./interfaces/c/instrument_api.h)
- A static library target: `sensor-lib`
- A command-line test tool: `instrument-cli`
- A repeated sensing stress test: `repeat-sensing-test`
- Existing example programs under [`examples/`](./examples/)

The implemented actions are:

- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_GET_ADAPTER_INFO`
- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_DISCOVER_DEVICES`
- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_IS_UP`
- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_TURN_ON`
- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_TURN_OFF`
- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_SCAN_ON`
- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_SCAN_OFF`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_GET_MY_DEVICE`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_DISCOVER_DEVICES`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_IS_UP`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_TURN_ON`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_TURN_OFF`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_SCAN_ON`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_SCAN_OFF`
- `INSTRUMENT_GPS_GET_POSITION`
- `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_DISCOVER_BRATISLAVA_LINKS`
- `INSTRUMENT_WIFI_DISCOVER_BRATISLAVA_LINKS`
- `INSTRUMENT_COMMS_DISCOVER_BRATISLAVA_LINKS`

The implemented callback path now includes:

- `registerCallback(INSTRUMENT_COMMS, LINK_DISCOVERED, ...)`
- `registerCallback(INSTRUMENT_COMMS, LINK_DROPPED, ...)`
- `registerCallback(INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH, DEVICE_DISCOVERED, ...)`
- `registerCallback(INSTRUMENT_WIFI, DEVICE_DISCOVERED, ...)`

When the API is created, a background comms runtime starts a Bluetooth L2CAP server and a Wi-Fi UDP server. The
runtime scans for Bluetooth peers and Wi-Fi ARP neighbors, attempts the `packet-comms` style `Hello Pi World` /
`Hello Back from ...` handshake, and publishes a `BratislavaLink` with an established socket fd when the handshake
completes. The dedicated link-callback harness runs indefinitely until interrupted and prints a per-iteration status
summary after each scan-and-connect cycle.

## Design Notes

### Memory and allocation model

The API is designed around caller-owned buffers:

- The caller allocates input and output arrays.
- The library writes results directly into those buffers.
- Output counts are returned through `output_len`.

This keeps memory ownership simple and makes leak avoidance much easier in C.

Current behavior by subsystem:

- Bluetooth discovery is selected at compile time behind a small scanner interface.
- The default `bluez` backend shells out to BlueZ userspace tools to perform a short discovery run and then enriches discovered devices with additional metadata when BlueZ exposes it.
- The optional `hci` backend uses low-level `hci_inquiry()`. BlueZ internally allocates the inquiry result buffer there, and the library frees it before returning.
- Wi-Fi scanning uses stack buffers and writes directly into the caller output array.
- GPS polling uses a stack receive buffer and returns a single `C_PositionInfo`.

### Bluetooth implementation choice: `bluez` vs `hci`

This project now supports two Bluetooth discovery implementations behind the same `INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_DISCOVER_DEVICES` action.

Pros of `bluez`:

- Richer device discovery, especially for BLE advertisers
- Results are closer to what users see from `bluetoothctl scan on`
- Better alignment with the system Bluetooth daemon and its view of the world

Cons of `bluez`:

- More runtime overhead
- Depends on BlueZ userspace tooling being present and functional
- Some transient BLE devices may still expose only minimal metadata

Pros of `hci` / raw HCI:

- Low overhead
- Simple fit for direct classic Bluetooth inquiry
- Good fallback when a very small low-level build is preferred

Cons of `hci` / raw HCI:

- Narrower discovery coverage, especially for BLE-heavy environments
- One-shot inquiry behavior tends to see fewer devices than BlueZ userspace scanning
- More likely to diverge from what desktop tools report

Why `bluez` is the default now:

- The main goal is richer discovery that looks more like `bluetoothctl`
- It produces materially better results on BLE-heavy hosts
- The old HCI path remains available for compile-time selection

## Dependencies

### Build-time

Required:

- C compiler with C11 support
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- CMake 3.18 or newer
- BlueZ development headers and library
- `libnl-3` and `libnl-genl-3` development headers and libraries

On Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS, install everything needed to build and exercise the current implementation with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake g++ libbluetooth-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev gpsd gpsd-clients pkg-config
```

Bluetooth discovery backends:

- `bluez` is the default backend and uses BlueZ userspace discovery via `bluetoothctl`, which tends to produce results closer to `bluetoothctl scan on`
- `hci` uses the older low-level `hci_inquiry()` path
- Choose the backend at configure time with `-DSENSOR_LIB_BLUETOOTH_SCANNER=bluez` or `-DSENSOR_LIB_BLUETOOTH_SCANNER=hci`

Headers/libraries used by the implementation:

- `bluetooth/bluetooth.h`
- `bluetooth/hci.h`
- `bluetooth/hci_lib.h`
- `linux/nl80211.h`
- `netlink/netlink.h`
- `netlink/genl/genl.h`
- Standard POSIX networking and ioctl headers

### Runtime

Bluetooth:

- Linux with BlueZ support
- A local Bluetooth adapter
- Sufficient permissions to query and control the adapter

Wi-Fi:

- Linux `nl80211`/cfg80211 support in the driver/kernel path used by the interface
- A local wireless interface
- Sufficient permissions to trigger scans or change interface state

GPS:

- `gpsd` listening on `127.0.0.1:2947`
- A GPS receiver visible to `gpsd`

Notes:

- GPS polling can succeed with `mode=MODE_NOT_SEEN` or `mode=MODE_NO_FIX` when `gpsd` is reachable but no valid fix is available yet.
- If `gpsd` is running but has no active receiver, the API returns a structured “no fix/no device yet” result instead of crashing or leaking resources.

## Build

From the repository root:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
```

To force a specific Bluetooth discovery backend:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DSENSOR_LIB_BLUETOOTH_SCANNER=bluez
cmake -S . -B build-hci -DSENSOR_LIB_BLUETOOTH_SCANNER=hci
```

Artifacts:

- `build/libsensor-lib.a`
- `build/libsensor-lib.so`
- `build/instrument-cli`
- `build/repeat-sensing-test`

## Usage

### CLI test application

The simplest way to exercise the implemented actions is the CLI tool:

```bash
./build/instrument-cli bluetooth
./build/instrument-cli wifi
./build/instrument-cli gps
./build/instrument-cli comms
./build/instrument-cli link-callback
./build/link-callback-test
./build/repeat-sensing-test
./build/repeat-sensing-test 50
```

Example output:

```text
Bluetooth adapters: 1
  [0] id=0 mac=2C:CF:67:56:88:BF name=hci0 flags=0x0000001D type=3
Bluetooth discoveries: 15
  [0] mac=E4:65:B8:C8:B1:72 name=IPSTube_C8B172 class=0/0/0 major=63
  [1] mac=6A:8C:78:F3:9E:7B name=6A-8C-78-F3-9E-7B class=0/0/0 major=63
  ...
  [14] mac=9C:83:06:F6:09:A5 name=Plamen's S26 Ultra class=12/2/90 major=2
```

```text

Wi-Fi discoveries: 1
  [0] mac=74:AC:B9:5F:73:11 ssid=Apolo rssi_valid=1 rssi_dbm=-53
```

```text
GPS count: 1
GPS mode: 3
GPS timestamp: 1783721659
GPS lat/lon/alt: 38.7566712850 -77.2266953040 46.412
```

The repeated sensing test performs Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS sensing back-to-back for `N` iterations, defaulting to `20`, with a fixed 2-second delay between iterations:

```bash
./build/repeat-sensing-test
./build/repeat-sensing-test 50
```

Behavior notes:

- The test creates one `InstrumentAPI` handle for the full run and reuses it across all iterations.
- `INSTRUMENT_API_NOT_SUPPORTED` is treated as a valid outcome for hosts that do not currently have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or GPS support available.
- At the end of the run, the test prints every unique Bluetooth and Wi-Fi discovery it saw, including the first local timestamp when that device was observed.
- On glibc-based Linux systems, the test also captures allocator usage after a warmup iteration and again at the end, then fails if retained heap usage keeps growing beyond a small allowance.

### Using the library from C

Basic flow:

1. Create an `InstrumentAPI` handle
2. Allocate output buffers sized to the relevant max constants
3. Call `instrumentAction(...)`
4. Inspect `output_len`
5. Destroy the API handle

Example:

```c
#include "instrument_api.h"
#include "bluetooth_typedef.h"

int main(void) {
    InstrumentAPIConfig config = {0};
    InstrumentAPI *api = createInstrumentAPI(config);
    if (api == NULL) {
        return 1;
    }

    BluetoothAdapterInfoBase adapters[BLUETOOTH_MAX_ADAPTERS];
    uint32_t adapter_count = 0;

    instrument_api_status_t status = api->instrumentAction(
        INSTRUMENT_BLUETOOTH_GET_ADAPTER_INFO,
        NULL,
        0,
        adapters,
        &adapter_count);

    destroyInstrumentAPI(api);
    return (status == INSTRUMENT_API_SUCCESS) ? 0 : 1;
}
```

## Test Cases

Current manual test coverage centers on the CLI app and direct runtime validation.

### Bluetooth tests

- Adapter enumeration returns at least one local adapter when hardware is present.
- BlueZ backend returns a richer set of nearby devices visible during the discovery window.
- HCI backend still builds and returns classic inquiry results when explicitly selected.
- Adapter up-state query returns a boolean.
- Adapter power on/off paths invoke the expected HCI device controls.

Suggested manual commands:

```bash
./build/instrument-cli bluetooth
```

### Wi-Fi tests

- Wireless adapter enumeration returns available local Wi-Fi interfaces.
- Scan results return available BSS/device entries visible at scan time.
- Interface up-state query returns a boolean.
- Interface power on/off uses standard network interface flags.

Suggested manual commands:

```bash
./build/instrument-cli wifi
```

### GPS tests

- `gpsd` reachable but no receiver: returns one record with `MODE_NOT_SEEN`
- Receiver present but no fix yet: returns one record with `MODE_NO_FIX`
- Receiver with live fix: returns one record with `MODE_2D` or `MODE_3D` and valid coordinates

Suggested manual commands:

```bash
./build/instrument-cli gps
```

Useful direct daemon inspection:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import socket
s = socket.socket()
s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 2947))
print(s.recv(4096).decode())
s.sendall(b'?WATCH={"enable":true,"json":true};\n?POLL;\n')
print(s.recv(4096).decode())
PY
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bluetooth discovery fails

Possible causes:

- No Bluetooth adapter present
- Adapter is down
- Insufficient privileges
- BlueZ stack or kernel support is unavailable
- BlueZ backend tooling is unavailable or discovery is blocked by the host stack state

### Wi-Fi discovery fails

Possible causes:

- No wireless interface present
- Driver does not support the `nl80211` scan path used here
- Scan trigger requires privileges
- Interface is down

### GPS returns zero coordinates or `MODE_NOT_SEEN`

Possible causes:

- `gpsd` is running but has no active GPS device
- Receiver is attached but no fix has been acquired yet
- `gpsd` is not bound to `127.0.0.1:2947`

Check:

```bash
ss -ltnp | grep 2947
systemctl status gpsd
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM* 2>/dev/null
```

## Limitations

- Wi-Fi scanning uses `nl80211` via `libnl`.
- Bluetooth discovery supports either a BlueZ-backed scan path or a classic HCI inquiry path. The default BlueZ backend usually finds more BLE devices, but some transient BLE entries still expose only partial metadata.
- GPS parsing currently targets `gpsd` JSON TPV/POLL messages and does not use `libgps`.
- Callback registration is not implemented.

## Future Work

- Add automated unit/integration tests
- Replace the current BlueZ userspace tool integration with a direct BlueZ IPC/client implementation
- Add configurable GPS host/port and longer polling/fix timeout behavior
- Implement callback registration and continuous scan support
